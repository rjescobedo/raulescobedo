# Hello, everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Raul and I am a freelance web and mobile developer. My journey began during the summer of 2021 when I was curious about the coding and the tech industry. I began by looking through some instructional YouTube videos, subscribed to Mosh Hamedani's program, and finally signed up for NuCamp's Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once I began, I knew this was going to be a special journey for me and my family; therefore, I later enrolled in their Full Stack Web and Mobile Development Bootcamp.

I have been married to my wife Kaitlin for 9 years and we have 3 beautiful children: Leo, Rachel, and Milo. I have been a middle school band director for 9 years and have loved the teaching aspect, but have also found my niche in design and creativity due to the sudden demand for online learning through the pandemic. Through my years of teaching, and the connections and relationships I've made in the music world, I've found my true passion of software engineering.
