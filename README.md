# Hello, everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Hi, I’m Raul Escobedo, a Freelance Web Developer specializing in Front-End Development with a strong passion for creativity and problem-solving.

I am currently studying Software Engineering at SMU/Flatiron School, building on my foundation from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp, where I earned a certification in Full Stack Web and Mobile Development in 2022. I also hold degrees in Music Education from the University of North Texas and Tuba Performance from Northwestern University.

For over a decade, I’ve served as the Head Band Director at Lamar Middle School and Fine Arts Academy, where I developed skills in leadership, communication, and design. In the summer of 2021, I discovered my love for software development and have been fully immersed in coding ever since!
