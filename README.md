# Hello, everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Raul Escobedo and I am a Freelance Web Developer, specializing in the Front-End. I am recent graduate from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp with a certification in Full Stack Web and Mobile Development, a music education graduate from the University of North Texas, and tuba performance graduate from Northwestern University. I have been the band director at Lamar Middle School and Fine Arts Academy since 2013. It was during the summer of 2021 that I encountered software development and I have been loving it ever since. 

I feel with my background in the arts, I have a keen eye for creativity and details. As a head band director, it has been important for me to clearly communicate with my students and families on any important activities happening, which I will be able to carry forward into software development. I have also designed many concert programs and assignments over the years. With this new career path, I feel I can continue to learn and to demonstrate my creativity.
